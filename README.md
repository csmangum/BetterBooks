# BetterBooks
Read a book without reading the entire book

My reading list grows a lot faster than I read. To be more efficient and touch more books, I want some specific capabilities to help me accomplish that.

Capabilities:
- Book and Chapter summaries (NLP powered)
- Knowledge Graph from book concepts and ideas (with a global KG as well)
- Extract popular highlights
- Search engine based on each book (or all together)
- Question answering bot trained on each book (I'll do this if I complete the other capabilities)
- Research if there has been any work on training models to critique or analyze a book

Then put the entire thing into some sort of web app or UI
